        title: 'AI Can’t Be Beautiful',
        topic: "The first is that machines are almost smart enough to replace every single one of us without exception. It’s not just factory workers and chess players that have something to fear.",
        content: `“The greed for destination obliterates the journey” — John O’Donohue

        Well, my fellow Gen Xers, it’s finally happening —we’re being confronted with two persistent threats that have plagued us since the seventies.

        The first is that machines are almost smart enough to replace every single one of us without exception. It’s not just factory workers and chess players that have something to fear. It’s artists, musicians, actors, writers, surgeons, lawyers, and toll booth operators.

        AI-generated art is the latest iteration of this, but it’s been coming for a long time. There’s even a term for it, which is as horrific as you might expect: AI singularity.

        From what I can tell, AI singularity is still conceptual. It refers to the moment that machines become smarter than us. There’s a company called Translated that’s attempting to quantify AI singularity by measuring the accuracy of AI-generated language translation. According to them, AI is quickly closing the gap between what expert human translaters can achieve versus optimized machine translation.

        How close are we to reaching singularity? Well, Translated says we have seven years until AI can translate speech as well as a human translator.

        I guess this means we still have time to unplug everything and pretend we never invented big data and Google and algorithms that know us better than we know ourselves.

        Let’s be honest. It’s far too late to stop what’s coming. We’ve been tethered to the internet for two decades, feeding it a bottomless diet of our words, pictures, music, video, and art. It won’t be long until the machines are better at being human than we are or (more likely) pretending to be human. This brings me to the second threat: the robot uprising.

        We were warned about this eventuality in countless movies. First, we had Hal, the sentient computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Hal starts out as a kind, helpful AI system, until he goes mad and murders the humans he’s supposed to protect.

        That movie was released a few years before I was born. I watched it several times as a child. I didn’t understand much at the time, but that’s the first example I had of AI and it imprinted itself on my brain like a baby dinosaur from Jurassic Park.

        In the early 80’s, Hollywood gave us murderous robots in both computer and human form. Gen X watched a computer named Joshua nearly start the third world war in a movie called Wargames. A year later, Arnold Schwarzenegger, cast as a buff humanoid robot, relentlessly stalked a terrified Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.

        The concept of autonomous robots felt very fictional and far away to 13-year-old me, but with Wargames and The Terminator, the seed of fear Hal had planted grew a bit more.

        Two years later, a movie called Short Circuit told the story of a robot that was struck by lightening which made it sentient. This was a cute one for the kids. Robots are cuddly! They’re harmless! But, they could also (gulp) assert their right to live. That was the whole point of the movie.

        By 1999, we had The Matrix and my generation’s visceral fear of intelligent machines was fully realized. The scene where a bald (yet beautiful) Keanu Reeves wakes up tethered to a machine, his body and mind nothing more than fuel for the robot collective, still haunts me.

        And now? We have ChatGPT.

        Look, I’m, not here to bash technology. I write about it for a living, after all. Tech lets companies scale! It eliminates repetitive tasks! It makes everything more efficient and effective!

        AI-driven tools also help me do my job. I use Otter, an AI-powered transcription tool, to record and transcribe my meetings. Discovering Otter was nothing short of life changing for me. I don’t need to take notes when I interview people — I simply let Otter do that work for me.

        I also use Quetext, a tool that analyzes and flags text for plagiarism. Quetext helps me avoid simply rephrasing something I’ve read (e.g., accidental plagiarism). I also use it to identify (and eliminate) overused phrases and cliches. When I’m tired, it’s really tempting to write terrible things like “low-hanging fruit” and “helps you grow at scale” instead of buckling down and being more creative.

        So, no, I’m not here to broadly condemn all AI-driven technology — just the stuff that’s making fake art. I don’t think AI-generated content and art is 100% bad. But, like all things robotic, art made by machines feels kind of…threatening.

        I am worried, but not about the robot uprising (at least, not yet.) I’m worried that the content created by ChatGPT, Dall-E, and similar tools will quickly overwhelm real-people art. I’m worried that it will fill our digital and physical spaces and make it harder for artists to be seen and heard and honored.

        I’m worried that OpenAI and machine learning and natural language processing — the stuff that makes robot brains tick — lessens the act of creating. It makes it all too easy. This means it’s ripe for abuse and commoditization. I mean, art is already being commoditized, but at least some of us are being paid fairly for the art we create.

        I’m worried that, soon, some of the stuff being cranked out by AI tools will become indistinguishable from human-generated content. AI-generated writing, in particular, feels like it’s close to reaching that ominous singularity. When that happens, will machines become poets? Will they write novels? Will they pen the next Pulitzer Prize winning essay?

        How can machines do any of these things?

        Right now, I don’t think that a machine can create something beautiful without the help of a human on the other end of the screen. What that means to me is that these AI tools, in all their iterations, are just tools.

        We can never be the things a machine can be — immortal, all-knowing, perfect. So I’m not even going to try. I’m not giving up. I’m just recognizing that, as a human being, I have my limitations.

        But it’s also true that machines can never be the things humans can be. They can mimic us, like parrots, throwing our words and images back at us in increasingly clever ways. But the true beauty that comes with creating art eludes them — at least for now.

        I asked ChatGPT what it thought about this and it agreed wholeheartedly, writing, “Humans have an innate creative capacity that machines simply cannot replicate. Machines may be able to mimic our words and images, but they lack the spirit, emotion and spontaneity that characterize art created by humans. It is this unique quality that sets us apart from machines and allows us to express ourselves in ways that are both meaningful and beautiful.”

        Okay, now I’m terrified.`,

        topic: "It’d be wonderful if a new year magically marked a new beginning. ",
        content: `It’d be wonderful if a new year magically marked a new beginning. But 2022, like all years, reminded us that the same things keep happening, that world events continue on in their own unpredictable way and that in the end, we control very little but our own actions and opinions.

        One of my favorite quotes — enough that I have it inscribed on the wall across the back of my bookstore — comes from the novelist Walter Mosley. “I’m not saying that you have to be a reader to save your soul in the modern world,” he said. “I’m saying it helps.”

        2023 stands before us promising nothing but the same difficulties and opportunities that last year and every year before it promised. Maybe even new and worse ones. What are you going to do about it? Will you be ready for it? Can you handle it?

        Books are an investment in yourself — investments that come in many forms: novels, nonfiction, how-to, poetry, classics, biographies. They help you think more clearly, be kinder, see the bigger picture, and improve at the things that matter to you. Books are a tradition that stretches back thousands of years and stretches forward to today, where people are still publishing distillations of countless hours of hard thinking on hard topics. Why wouldn’t you avail yourself of this wisdom?

        With that in mind, here are 12 books — some new, some old — that will help you meet the goals that matter for 2023, that will help you live better and be better.

        ​Put Your Ass Where Your Heart Wants To Be by Steven Pressfield

        Before I start any book project, I take a few hours and re-read The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, maybe the greatest book ever written on the creative process. Well, on this book I just started, I changed it up a little because I got an early copy of Pressfield’s new book, Put Your Ass Where Your Heart Wants to Be. I love the title so much because it’s the perfect advice for nearly every difficult thing. If you want to get in shape, put your ass in the gym. If you want to have a great relationship with your kids, get your ass down on the floor where they’re playing. If you want to write a book, put your ass in the chair. Even when you’re tired. Even when you don’t want to. Even when you don’t see the point. That’s what it’s about. You don’t have to be perfect, but you do have to show up. (In a word, he’s also talking about discipline). I was very glad to have him out to interview about the book too, (which you can listen to here).

        ​Range by David Epstein

        David was one of my few author friends who did not discourage me from opening a bookstore. He was consistent in encouraging me to extend my range! I loved this book when it came out, and have often told people I think it’s a parenting book in disguise. It opens with the contrasting careers of Roger Federer and Tiger Woods, one a specialist from an early age, the other a generalist (who seemed to have a much more pleasant childhood and life), but both became great. I have always seen myself as a multi-hyphenate and believe my books have benefited from the experiences, interests, and occupations I’ve had. Having range also makes you more resilient in a recession. Those who are relying exclusively on one industry or company or job are the most vulnerable. I recommend pairing this book with Robert Greene’s Mastery… both are classics in my eyes.

        ​Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

        For this piece last year, I recommended this new annotated edition by Robin Waterfield. I’m a champion of the Gregory Hays translation but reading a new translation of a book you’ve read (or love) is a great way to see the same ideas from a new angle…or find new ideas you missed on the previous go-arounds. Marcus, like Heraclitus, believed we never step in the same river twice. More recently, I had a similar experience. Since my 16-year-old (nearly) completely marked-up copy was starting to get a little worse for wear, I created a premium edition designed to stand the test of time, just like the content inside. That’s the amazing thing about reading Marcus — whichever translation you go with — year after year, he feels both incredibly timely and incredibly timeless. There’s a reason this book has endured now for almost twenty centuries (here are some lessons from me having read Meditations more than 100 times). If you haven’t read Marcus Aurelius or if you have…you should read this book and then read it again.

        ​The Choice: Embrace the Possible by Dr. Edith Eva Eger

        ​I told Dr. Edith Eger I felt guilty about someone I had lost touch with and only recently reconnected with. She cut me off and told me she could give me a gift that would solve that guilt right now. “I give you a sentence,” she said, “One sentence — if I knew then what I know now, I would have done things differently.” That’s the end of that, she said. “Guilt is in the past, and the one thing you cannot change is the past.” Dr. Eger is a complete hero of mine. At 16-years-old, she’s sent to Auschwitz. And how does this not break a person? How do they survive? How do they endure the unendurable? And how do they emerge from this, not just not broken, but cheerful and happy and of service to other people? The last thing Dr. Eger’s mother said to her before she was sent to the gas chambers was that very Stoic idea: even when we find ourselves in horrendous situations, we can always choose how we respond to them, who we’re going to be inside of them, what we’re going to hold onto inside of them. Dr. Eger quotes Frankl, who she later studied under, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” It was this idea that allowed Dr. Eger to not only endure unimaginable suffering, but to find meaning in it. She went on to become a psychologist and survives to this day, still seeing patients and helping people overcome trauma. I’ve had the incredible honor of interviewing Dr. Eger twice (here and here) and the joy and energy of this woman, this 95-year-old Holocaust survivor, is just incredible.

        ​The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness by Morgan Housel

        This year began with a booming economy, and is ending in recession. Crypto has crashed. The real estate market is not so hot. If you’re looking to navigate the whipsawing, unpredictable nature of the global economy as an individual who hopes to plan (and be secure) for the future, I think this book is a great one. It’s filled with great stories–like the kind I try to tell in my books–that teach big lessons. There’s no better way to learn in my eyes…I had a great conversation with Morgan on the podcast, which you might also like. But speaking of podcasts and financial advice, I have LOVED–like LOVED–Ramit Sethi’s podcast this year which focuses on couples and their financial issues. It’s riveting and super educational. I’ve learned a ton. Here’s my interview with Ramit in that regard.

        ​The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer

        The past few years have proved that many people miss this about the philosophy, but Stoicism isn’t just an individualistic philosophy. It’s a collective philosophy. The Stoics tells us to think not just about how our actions impact other people, but what we owe other people and how we can orient our actions and our lives around that. Peter Singer is pioneer of the “effective altruism” movement and just a wonderful example of someone who has oriented everything he does around other people. Sam Bankman-Fried put EA in the news but let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. EA has guided a lot of good — more than most philosophies — to people all over the world.

        ​Leadership: In Turbulent Times by Doris Kearns Goodwin

        This is an absolutely incredible book. I think I marked up nearly every page. The book is a study of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, FDR and Lyndon Johnson, and it is so clearly the culmination of a lifetime of research… and yet somehow not overwhelming or boring. Distillation at its best! I have read extensively on each of those figures and I got a ton out of it. Even stuff I already knew, I benefited from Goodwin’s perspective. This is the perfect book to read right now — a timely reminder that leadership matters. Or as the Stoics say: character is fate.

        ​Phosphorescence: A Memoir of Finding Joy When Your World Goes Dark by Julia Baird

        I LOVED Julia Baird’s biography of Queen Victoria and have raved about it many times. When I heard she was writing a follow up, I assumed it would be another biography. I did not expect this powerful, inspiring book about resilience and powering through. Through some dark times, Julia said what sustained her was “yielding a more simple phosphorescence — being luminous at temperatures below incandescence, having stored light for later use, quietly glowing without combusting. Staying alive, remaining upright, even when lashed by doubt.” She’s basically talking about Stoicism…without talking about Stoicism (though she does that too). I found myself marking dozens of pages in this one and just continually smiling throughout. It’s a great little book and, among other things, reminds me why I need to get back into swimming. I had a great conversation with Julia on the podcast, which you can listen to here.

        ​A Calendar of Wisdom by Leo Tolstoy

        Tolstoy believed his most essential work was not his novels but his daily read, A Calendar of Wisdom. As Tolstoy wrote in his diary, the continual study of one text, reading one page at the start of each day, was critical to personal growth. “Daily study,” Tolstoy wrote in 1884, is “necessary for all people.” So Tolstoy dreamed of creating a book composed of “a wise thought for every day of the year, from the greatest philosophers of all times and all people… Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Lao-Tzu, Buddha, Pascal.” As he wrote to his assistant, “I know that it gives one great inner force, calmness, and happiness to communicate with such great thinkers… They tell us about what is most important for humanity, about the meaning of life and about virtue.” As you can imagine, I am a big fan of daily devotionals. Check out DailyStoic.com and DailyDad.com for the free daily email versions I do.

        ​Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther

        Written in 1949 by the famous journalist John Gunther about the death of his genius son Johnny at 17 from a brain tumor, this book is deeply moving and profound. It’s impossible to not be awed by this young boy who knows he will die too soon and struggles to do it with dignity and purpose. Midway through the book, Johnny writes what he calls the Unbeliever’s Prayer. It’s good enough to be from Epictetus or Montaigne — and he was just 16 when he wrote it. It’s worth reading the book for that alone.

        ​Buddha by Karen Armstrong

        It’s scholarly without being pedantic, inspiring without being mystical. Armstrong is actually a former Catholic nun (who teaches at a college of Judaism), so I loved the diverse and unique perspective of the author. And Armstrong never misses the point of a good biography: to teach the reader how to live through the life of an interesting, complicated but important person.

        ​Gift From The Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh

        I always associated Charles Lindbergh with Hawaii because when I was a kid, I visited his grave at the end of the road to Hana in Maui. I was totally surprised to find this book at one of my favorite bookstores, Sundog Books, in one of my favorite places in the world, 30A in Florida. It’s a beautiful philosophical book about rest and relaxation. For each chapter, Lindbergh takes a shell from the beach as the starting point for a meditation on topics like solitude, love, happiness, contentment, and so on. For a 67-year-old book, it feels surprisingly modern–especially, I would think, for women. The only thing I didn’t like about this book is that I didn’t read it when I was writing Stillness is the Key as I almost certainly would have quoted it many times.

        ***

        As I have published different versions of this piece over the last couple of years (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022), I made one final recommendation worth repeating: Pick 3–4 titles that have had a big impact on you in the past and commit to reading them again. Seneca talked about how you need to “linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind.”

        We never read the same book twice. Because we’ve changed. The perceptions about the book have changed. What we’re going through in this very moment is new and different. So this year, go reread The Great Gatsby. Give The Odyssey another chance. Sit with a few chapters from The 48 Laws of Power. See how these books have stood the test of time and see how you’ve changed since you’ve read them last.

        It can be some of the best time you spend with a book this year. Happy reading!`,

        title: 'The problem-solver’s playbook: 17 questions to sharpen your thinking',
        topic: "",
        content: `If somebody had asked me years ago to distil product management in two words, I’d have answered: solving problems. Isn’t that our main job? Find out what the customer’s problems are and solve them. Bam, job done, give me the applause I deserve!

        Now, the problem with being passionate about problem-solving was that when I saw a problem, my instinctive reaction was “How can I solve it?” I was a problem slut: I was attracted too easily to too many problems. That means:

        I usually ended up burning out quickly trying to solve all the problems myself.
        I also often felt frustrated when I couldn’t get enough buy-ins and resources to solve the problems.
        And, worst of all, I got bored easily when executing the solution, as I have already fallen in love with another problem.
        A picture of a man holding hand with a woman, walking past another woman. The man turned back at the other woman, admiring her beauty while the woman he’s with looked annoyed.
        This was me
        After many episodes of burnout and frustration, I learned my lesson. If you ask me now what my job is, I’ll answer: multiplying value. That means that I only work on problems worth solving, in a way that delivers the optimal value for the customers.

        By focusing on multiplying value rather than solving problems, one actually becomes a better problem solver.

        Here are 17 explorative questions to help you sharpening your thinking, divided into 3 sections.

        Section 1: Assessing if your problem is worth solving
        This section is useful if you already have a problem in mind. You might come across it from reading customer feedback, talking to the support team, or watching a customer recording. Using the dating analogy, this is the part where you make sure your crush is worth falling in love with.

        #1: Is this problem merely a symptom of a bigger problem?
        It’s always worth taking the time to ask the 5-Whys and make sure that you get to the addressable root cause and not just solve the most visible symptom.

        One simple example: If a sign up to a certain feature is low and you see that there are some usability issues in the form, it’s easy to jump straight and fix those form issues. (Or worse, you see the usability issues first, and then you dig the sign up number to confirm that this is a problem. That’s a confirmation bias right there!)

        Meanwhile, the sign up might be low because the feature isn’t bringing adequate value (quality issue), or it doesn’t bring the value customers need (product-market fit issue). This is why it’s important to dig qualitative and quantitative insights to get the full picture.

        #2: How impactful is this problem for the customers?
        The answer to this question isn’t as simple as ‘nice to have’ or ‘must have’. There are three dimensions you need to consider in assessing the impact of a problem:

        Reach: the number of customers this problem is impacting. This is a real, objective number.
        Intensity: how deep the pain caused by this problem is. This one is a slightly arbitrary scale of low-medium-high, or you can use a scale of 1–10, up to you. As far as possible, the assignment of the score should be based on user research.
        User segment: who are the customers impacted by this problem. Some of your customers are more valuable to the business than others. You can use a multiplier here, e.g. segment A and B are 1x in value, but segment C has 2x value.
        Impact = reach * intensity * user segment

        Thinking about these three dimensions separately allows you to assess the importance of a problem more comprehensively.

        Quantifying impact: Reach — number of people impacted (a picture of a group of people). Intensity — the intensity of their pain (a picture of a woman with a headache). User segment — the value of the segment to the company (a picture of a crown).
        #3: How will solving this problem benefit the company?
        Guess what, what the customers need and what the company wants aren’t always aligned. I was that bright-eyed, idealistic young woman trying to solve customers’ problems when the company couldn’t care less because it wasn’t profitable for them to do so. After all, companies are created to make a profit by serving customers’ needs.

        I have one trick to tip this one in your favor: think about how this problem can harm the company in the long term. Maybe there’s no clear short-term incentive to solve this issue for the business, but over time, it can erode the trust in your company and hurt long-term profitability.

        #4: Does it align with the company/product’s long-term vision and strategy?
        Even when a problem is impactful for the customers and profitable to solve for the company, it might not align with its vision. A simple example is if the problem is on the web, while the company wants to focus on the app.

        Saying ‘no’ to an important problem when it doesn’t align with the company/product’s vision is paramount to maintaining focus. To quote Michael Porter, ‘The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.’

        #5: What do you need to deprioritize to work on this?
        You only have a finite resource and when you work on a certain problem, it means you’re not working on other problems. That’s your opportunity cost: the potential loss from a missed opportunity.

        Think about the next thing(s) you’re going to work on if you’re not working on this problem, and make sure that you can afford that cost.

        #6: What happens if you do nothing?
        Thinking about the cost of delay, or the cost of doing nothing, is a powerful exercise to do. You also get to see that some problems are like a fire — you either have to solve them now or rebuild later. Other problems are like a leaking roof — it gets worse and worse slowly until the whole roof falls down. Some other problems are like a puddle of water — it’s annoying but it doesn’t harm anyone as long as everyone knows to walk around it.

        Not all problems are created equal. A picture of a woman with a fire. Fire: fix it now or rebuild later. A picture of a man under a leaking pipe. Leaking roof: Slowly getting worse. A picture of a woman near a puddle. Puddle: annoying but not harmful.
        Section 2: Finding a problem that matters
        Going back to the dating analogy — you know what wise men say, ‘Being single is great because you get to think about what you really want in your partner!’ Similarly, when you’re not thinking about a particular problem, you have more space to think above and beyond.

        This is also what usually differentiates a more junior and senior product managers. Senior PMs would identify and scope opportunities to make the product 10x, instead of just 10%, better.

        #7: What is the customer’s job-to-be-done?
        Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework prompts you to think wider than your product usability problems. When a user flies from London to Dublin, their goal is not to ride a plane, it’s to meet their colleagues. If you’re an airline company, your threat of substitution isn’t just fellow airlines, it’s also Zoom and Google Meet.

        Understanding the reason your customers ‘hire’ your product gives you a clear direction to improve your product. Airbnb users are looking to have a nice holiday, not just a place to stay — hence Airbnb Experience was born.

        #8: How can I build a deeper moat for my product?
        A moat is a deep pool of water surrounding a castle — it serves as a way to defend the castle against an attack. Building a moat in business or product means making it hard for new entrants or competitors to steal your customers.

        One of the most popular way to build a moat is creating network effects: where increased numbers of people using your product increase the value of your product for each individual.

        Network effects are obvious in products like social media(which is useless if you have no friends, or nobody to follow) or marketplace (which again is useless if the customers can’t find the product/service they need, or the sellers don’t find any buyers). But you can also implement network effects in other products by making an activity that’s typically done on your own (e.g. exercising or investing) and adding a social element to it.

        Network effect is just one way to build a moat. You can also deter customers from switching by creating emotional attachment to your product, patenting your technology, etc. Recommended reading: building growth moats without network effect.

        #9: If a new hotshot founder creates a pitch deck to disrupt my industry, what will they say about my company/product?
        Your company/product might have been created a few years ago with the same ambition: to disrupt a broken industry. You named 50-year-old companies as the enemy and pitched your solution as the revolutionary savior.

        The irony is that you can easily slide into being that old enemy in just a few years time if you stop innovating.

        The society is evolving faster than ever and the bar is raised constantly. If you don’t disrupt your own product, somebody else will.

        #10: What future situation can make my product irrelevant?
        The pandemic came as a blow to many companies. Products relying on people traveling or gathering suddenly became paralyzed, and they had to pivot quickly to online events or other means to make money.

        Pandemic at the scale of Covid-19 is probably a once-every-century occurrence, but it doesn’t mean there won’t be other situations that make your product irrelevant. Regulatory change is one possible scenario.

        It also doesn’t have to be an overnight revolutionary change. A slow evolution such as the rise of renewable energy, electric vehicles, plant-based meat alternatives, job sharing, etc can impact your product. Keep a lookout because the future is already there, it’s just not evenly distributed.

        Section 3: Discovering the best solution
        When people talk about product discovery, often the focus is on problem discovery. The old adage of ‘PM owns the problem, engineers own the solution’ could also make PMs reluctant to go into the solution space.

        I totally agree that a PM shouldn’t decide on, or, God forbid, specify the solution in a silo. But a PM should still be driving the solution discovery process, by amassing the expertise of engineers, designers, data scientists, and the stakeholders.

        #11: How much is our appetite to solve this problem?
        To put simply, how much resources do you want to allocate? How long do you want the designers and engineers to spend on this? A task can expand to fill the time and space it’s been given, as the Parkinson’s law suggested.

        It’s important to clarify the boundaries early and communicate them to the team.

        #12: What is feasible to build?
        A good solution is desirable by the users, viable for the business, and feasible to build with the resources and constraints you have.

        Assuming that you’ve done your homework from question 1–11, I assumed that your solution is likely desirable and viable. The feasibility aspect is the one you need to figure out now, by leveraging the expertise of your engineers (and other technical function such as data scientists).

        The importance of this discovery can’t be overstated. There’s a world of difference between an array of solutions. For example, my team at Bulb was exploring giving energy savings advice on the app. The solution can be an array of:

        Creating a banner linking to a blog post containing generic advice
        Breaking down the advice and making it look ‘native’ to the app
        Personalizing the advice by only showing the ones applicable to the users (e.g. don’t say ‘improve your house’s insulation’ if the house is a new-built)
        Personalizing the advice by showing the saving amount (e.g. by doing this, you could save £20 / year)
        The third and fourth solution requires user data that we might not have, so it might not be feasible for now. Equipped with this knowledge, you can make a decision e.g. build the second solution now, while doing some research on the value of #3 and #4 to see if it’s worth building. Which brings me to the next point: diminishing return.

        #13: Where is the point of diminishing return?
        The most complex solution is almost certainly the most expensive one to build. The good news is, your customers might not need it! A solution that takes half the time to build might perform 80% of the job — diminishing return principle might apply here.

        You can test this by building an MVP version of the solution, ship it to a small % of users, and measure the impact. Improve the solution via small iterations rather than spending months and months building the perfect solution.

        #14: What would the Red Team say about this solution?
        The ‘Red Team’ is an exercise to look at your solution as if you’re the enemy, biggest critic or competitor. The job of the Red Team is to poke holes in the solution and challenge you with everything that could go wrong. It’s a useful exercise because your actual competitor might do the same thing later.

        You can also imagine the most cynical press review you might possibly get. Especially if your company is under quite a lot of spotlight, this might be a completely feasible scenario. (I still remember the time the press wrote the headline ‘Facebook asks users for nude photos’…)

        #15: What is the riskiest assumption we have here? How can we de-risk it?
        Solutions are based on assumptions — that customers want to do certain actions, that engineers can build something in a certain way, etc. Your team might have different confidence level in those assumptions. And each assumption also has different level of importance in making your solution works.

        Try to map out those assumptions in a 2x2 scale of confidence and importance so you can identify which assumptions you need to de-risk.

        #16: What is the smallest chunk of value we can deliver?
        As much as possible, I avoid building for months and releasing a fully-fledged feature in a big bang. No matter how much research and testing you’ve done, the true test of a feature success is when it’s launched to the wild. Time lag between research and launching increases the chance of changes in requirements, trends, and appetite.

        For that reason, I always advocate for phasing your build plan. Focus on releasing small chunks of value and iterate.

        This is also important when your feature is solving an apparent pain point. Your customers will appreciate a solution that alleviates 60% of their problem now, rather than something that alleviates 100% of the problem but in a year’s time.

        #17: Am I the best person to solve this?
        You might be thinking — What? After going through 16 questions to refine this problem and define the solution, you wanted me to give this to someone else?

        Yes, particularly if your company is scaling up quickly and you’re becoming a more senior member of the team. Don’t be afraid to give away your Legos — that’s how you actually grow. By empowering a more junior team member to work on this problem, you get to a) learn new skills (e.g. delegating, mentoring) and b) free up your time to do more impactful work.`,
